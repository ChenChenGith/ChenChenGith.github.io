Students don't know enough to be able to edit the prompt to reach a sensible code chunk, AI guessed and guessed wrong. We should not expect AI to guess information that we do not provide! 

Students should still learn to code, and teachers should ask better questions - instead of asking for the final result (create a bar plot), ask students to critically think: why doesn't the AI-generated code work? what information is missing? how do you improve the prompt?
