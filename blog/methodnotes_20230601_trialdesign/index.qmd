* Coursera course [Design and interpretation of clinical trials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/clinical-trials/home/) by Johns Hopkins University



## Types of trials designs

Phase 1: 10-30, identify tolerable dose, information on drug metabolism, extretion and toxicity. Often not controlled

Phase 2: 30-100, efficacy, safety and side effects, 

Phase 3: 100+, often randomized 

Phase 4: demonstration

### Types of design 

Population have the disease outcome of interest; not healthy voluteers vs diseased.

Randomisation unit: persons, two eyes of a person, or groups of persons

**Comparison structure**: parallel, crossover, group allocation

* **Parallel**: simultaneous treatment and control groups, subjects randomly assigned to one group.
* **Crossover**: randomize of order in which treatments are received; TC or CT. Each patient is his/her own control. Washout period: time between two treatments.
  * Variability reduced because less variability within patient than between patients. Fewer patients needed. 
  * Disadvantages: only certain treatments can use crossover design, treatment can't have permanent effects. Carry-over effects from first period; washout needs to be long enough. Dropouts more significant, analysis may be more difficult: correlated outcomes.
  * Constant intensity of underlying disease: chronic diseases (e.g. asthma, hypertension, arthritis) + short-term treatment effects (relief of signs or symptoms)
  * e.g. morning dose vs evening dose
* **Group allocation**: a group of subjects (community, school, clinic).

**Extensions of the parallel design**: factorial, large simple

* **Factorial**: two interventions tested simultaneously. Can be presented in a 2 by 2 table (treatment A +-, treatment B +-); or 3 by 2 etc.
  * Interested in main effect (if no interaction expected). A vs no A; B vs no B. The other treatment doesn't matter.

* **Large simple**: large number of patients, possibly from many study sites.

#### Tests other than superiority

* **Equivalency**: intervention response is close to control group response

* **Non-inferiority**: Treatment A (new) is at least as good as B (established). One-sided test, if A is worse than B, one can be rejected. Does not require as big sample size.


#### Adaptive design

Possible adaptations

* **randomization probabilities** 
* **sample size** (e.g. group sequential methods)
* **visit schedule**: shorten/lengthen follow-up time, change number of timing of visits, treatments (dose/duration, concomitant meds)
* **hypothesis** tested




## Randomisation and masking 

Rationale: 

* avoid selection bias: prognostic factors related to treatment assignment
* tends to produce comparable treatment groups

Selection bias
