## Types of trials designs

Phase 1: 10-30, identify tolerable dose, information on drug metabolism, extretion and toxicity. Often not controlled

Phase 2: 30-100, efficacy, safety and side effects, 

Phase 3: 100+, often randomized 

Phase 4: demonstration

### Types of design 

Population have the disease outcome of interest; not healthy voluteers vs diseased.

Randomisation unit: persons, two eyes of a person, or groups of persons

**Comparison structure**: parallel, crossover, group allocation

* **Parallel**: simultaneous treatment and control groups, subjects randomly assigned to one group.
* **Crossover**: randomize of order in which treatments are received; TC or CT. Each patient is his/her own control. Washout period: time between two treatments.
  * Variability reduced because less variability within patient than between patients. Fewer patients needed. 
  * Disadvantages: only certain treatments can use crossover design, treatment can't have permanent effects. Carry-over effects from first period; washout needs to be long enough. Dropouts more significant, analysis may be more difficult: correlated outcomes.
  * Constant intensity of underlying disease: chronic diseases (e.g. asthma, hypertension, arthritis) + short-term treatment effects (relief of signs or symptoms)
  * e.g. morning dose vs evening dose
* **Group allocation**: a group of subjects (community, school, clinic).

**Extensions of the parallel design**: factorial, large simple

* **Factorial**: two interventions tested simultaneously. Can be presented in a 2 by 2 table (treatment A +-, treatment B +-); or 3 by 2 etc.
  * Interested in main effect (if no interaction expected). A vs no A; B vs no B. The other treatment doesn't matter.

* **Large simple**: large number of patients, possibly from many study sites.

#### Tests other than superiority

* **Equivalency**: intervention response is close to control group response

* **Non-inferiority**: Treatment A (new) is at least as good as B (established). One-sided test, if A is worse than B, one can be rejected. Does not require as big sample size.


#### Adaptive design

Possible adaptations

* **randomization probabilities** 
* **sample size** (e.g. group sequential methods)
* **visit schedule**: shorten/lengthen follow-up time, change number of timing of visits, treatments (dose/duration, concomitant meds)
* **hypothesis** tested




## Randomisation and masking 

Rationale: 

* avoid **selection bias**: prognostic factors related to treatment assignment
* tends to produce comparable treatment groups

### Schemes

Simple randomization, restricted randomization, adaptive randomization

#### Simple rz

Each assignment is unpredictable, number of patients in each group should be equal in the long run.

Risks: imbalances in number assigned to treatment groups, or confounding factors (gender, disease severity) -> reduced power

#### Restricted rz

Schemes with constraints to produce expected assignment ratio 

* blocking
* stratification

Blocking. Block of size 2 with treatment allocation ratio 1:1: A,B. Size 4: 2As, 2Bs. Need to be permuted: AABB, ABAB, ... in total 6 combinations. Then choose one of the permutations.

Stratification. Ensure balance in treatment assignments with subgroups defined before rz. Limit to a few variables (highly related to outcome and/or logistical): e.g. clinic in a multicenter trial, surgeon (skills, procedures), stage of disease, demographic such as gender and age.

Use these two together.


#### Adaptive rz

Probability of assignment does not remain constant, but determined by the current balance and composition of the groups.

* minimization: choose the design that gives the smallest imbalance.
* play the winner: change allocation ratio or favor the better treatment based on the primary outcome. Need to evaluate outcomes relatively quickly.


### Masking (blinding)

Treatment assignment is not known *after* rz.

* patient, clinical personnel, evaluators, data processors, ...
* single (only participant), double (+ investigator), triple (+ data processors, ...), quadruple ...

Purpose: remove bias related to treatment effects.

Different levels of masking protects to different extent against bias in different aspects

* data reporting
* data collection / follow-up
* testing, behaviors
* outcome assessment

Decision to mask treatments

* ethical?
* possible? can you make the treatment seem identical so the participants do not know?
* trial design features: more important to mask subjective ones (e.g. alive or dead is the least subjective, hence wouldn't benefit much; however if participants need to report effects that are not objectively measureable, they might report that treatment is better in contrast to placebo group)
* feasible? cost-benefit, practicality (adherence)

Sometimes investigators in a double blind study might know which treatment is being assigned to participants, if the effect of drug is very obvious (both good or bad).

Unmasking 

* Planned: inform participants once the trial finished
* Unplanned (discouraged): in the event of adverse event
