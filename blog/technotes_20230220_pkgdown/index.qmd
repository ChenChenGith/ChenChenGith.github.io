  A workflow that worked for me: when you have a few vignette documents, and want to display them nicely in a website format.

# 1. Create the website skeleton.

Before editing the details, we need to create the skeleton for the website. It can be done with `usethis` and `pkgdown` packages.

In R, run this: 

```
usethis::use_pkgdown()
```
This creates the `_pkgdown.yml` file, which is the place you configure your site.


To view the initial package website, use the following command:
```
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This creates `docs/` directory containing a website

* `README.md` becomes the homepage,
* documentation in `man/` generates a function reference,
* vignettes are rendered into `articles/`.


# 2. Edit the vignette documentation

Make sure that the vignette index is consistent with **Title**, otherwise it will not render.

# 3. Build site

Now check if the site looks good, and contents are correctly positioned.
```
pkgdown::build_site()
```

# 4. Deploy site with GitHub Pages
