# Overview

(The book reading is still ongoing)

# Notes from each chapter

## Learn from COVID

Some mistakes

* Federal agencies refused to share data
* Persons responsible did not have training inn epidemiology
* Not enough testing, not fast enough 
* Lacks information sharing


## Create a pandemic prevention team

There should be a global expert team to help preventing the pandemic: they *should* be responsible for

* surveillance of potential disease outbreaks, sound the alert when necessary;
* creation and sharing of data system and data on cases
* standardising policy making and training
* evaluation of the capacity of individual countries
* coordination of personnels

However it is difficult even for all countries to reach an agreement, and secure the funds. There is no **one organisation** that is able to join forces from all parties. Organisations depend on **volunteers**. WHO lacks funds, experts who are specialised in pandemic research, and relies on the free global response networks. 

A team, **GERM (Global Epidemic Response and Mobilisation)** should be established. The main task should be **disease surveillance** and modeling; rather than treating patients.


## Get better at detecting outbreaks early

### Disease surveillance

**Passive surveillance**: healthcare workers report cases that use healthcare services (e.g. clinic, hospital) to public health authorities.

**Active surveillance**: workers go to communities to find potential patients that have not been to clinics or hospitals due to inconvenience, or mild symptoms.

When there are many cases (clusters), the signal might be picked up by a computer algorithm, and alerts sent to healthcare workers so that they pay more attention.

In some countries, personnels other than healthcare workers (e.g. teachers, post office staff) might also participate in disease surveillance. In addition, some virus can be detected in the environment such as **waste water** (e.g. polio, illeagal drug). 

### Birth and death

In LMIC (low and middle income countries), there are higher percentage of unrecorded births ad deaths. Some of them carry out census every other year - no real time data. Some data are also lack information such as cause of death. Without knowing causes of death (such as diarrhea), it is impossible to prevent the disease. 

Post-mortem (autopsy) can be unattainable, especially in LMIC. It could also be undesirable for families who have lost their loved ones - procedures are very invasive. Nevertheless, alternatives exist, such as minimally invasive autopsy technologies like MRI and MRI guided fine-needle biopsy.



## Help people protect themselves right away

## Find new treatment fast

## Get ready to make vaccines

## Practice, practice, practice

## Close the health gap between rich and poor countries

## Make and fund a plan for preventing pandemics
