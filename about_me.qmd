::: {#hero-heading}

:::

I am a statistical programmer and lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo. Over the past few years, I've become very interested in **research software, open source** and **data science** practices in education and public sector.


My **interests** are: 

* Statistical software development, with a focus on public health and clinical research
* Statistics education with R, Quarto, shiny and friends
* Reproducibility, open source and open science


I have a MSc of Statistics from Imperial College London in 2016. Then I moved to Norway to do my PhD and some [hiking](misc info/photo3_chi.jpg). I obtained my PhD (thesis: *Representation and Utilization of hospital Electronic Health Records data*) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo in 2022.

Shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, I joined [Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/en/) as **R developer** and **statistician** for the open source real-time analysis and public health surveillance system, [Sykdomspulsen](https://docs.sykdomspulsen.no). I am one of the core members of [CSIDS](https://github.com/csids), the Consortium for Statistics in Disease Surveillance, where we build open source software for public health surveillance. 

I teach **statistics** courses (MF9130, MF9130E, ERN4110) at Oslo Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology ([OCBE](https://www.med.uio.no/imb/english/research/centres/ocbe/)). As a certified Carpentries instructor, I also teach and help with **R programming** at the [Carpentries workshops](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/carpentry-uio/) at University of Oslo. I am an active member of Oslo User R group and Oslo R ladies group.

In the past 11 years I have lived in the UK and Norway (7+ years). I speak English, Norwegian and Chinese, and trying to learn Italian. I like outdoor activities, and most likely I am spending my summer in the mountains.
