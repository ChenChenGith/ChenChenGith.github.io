### Public health surveillance and reporting

I worked at Norwegian Institute of Public Health during Covid-19 pandemic, focusing on real-time infectious disease surveillance and real-time large scale reporting using R.

### Teaching

I started teaching introductory statistics at Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo since early 2023. I aim to make basic data skills and statistics accessible to health researchers, by combining modern data science tools (R, quarto, version control) with hands-on practice in my class.

In my free time I volunteer in the Carpentries workshops to teach Rstats to researchers and students at UiO.


### R packgages

I developed / co-developed several R packages used for public health surveillance: `covidnor`, `cstime`, `csdata`, `csmaps` which are part of the [CSIDS](https://github.com/csids/). 

My current ongoing R packages focus on facilitating statistical education: `qtwAcademic`.
