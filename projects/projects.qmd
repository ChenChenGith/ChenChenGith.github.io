### Open source data science in healthcare

I work on open source data science projects with healthcare applications. Here are a few projects that I'm working on at the moment.

### Public health

In 2020-2022, I worked at Norwegian Institute of Public Health during Covid-19 pandemic. I helped develop Sykdomspulsen (now **CSIDS**), a real-time infectious disease surveillance and real-time large scale reporting with open source technology. 

Since 2023, I joined **Noreden** project at University of Oslo. I help develop a set of R tools to facilitate sustainable diet design.
