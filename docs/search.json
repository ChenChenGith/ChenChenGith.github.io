Back then it was THE way to build a personal website using R. During the past years I also tried distill for a clean, minimalistic website.\nAnd then I stopped updating my website. Between 2020 and early 2022, I was too stressed about completing my PhD, and balancing my other two jobs wasn’t the easiest thing. Now that I’ve finally completed the more pressing tasks, I can catch up to the cool kids on twitter: create a website with Quarto!"
