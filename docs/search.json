Sykdomspulsen processes new data collected from 15 data sources (e.g., covid-19 cases), runs 1000.000+ statistical analysis automatically for all locations (nation, county, municipality) in Norway, produces 1000+ reports and alerts for public health authorities and shares data to the public on GitHub.\nSykdomspulsen runs on a collection of R packages, the {splverse}. {splverse} is an ecosystem for infectious disease surveillance, from analysis planning, statistical analysis to reporting via visualization, shiny website and Rmarkdown generated reports. In this talk, Chi will present how Sykdomspulsen does public health real-time surveillance during the pandemic using R. Chi will introduce some of the core packages and illustrate how they work together, with an example using real surveillance data published daily on GitHub.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\nChi is currently working at the Sykdomspulsen team as a researcher and R developer, at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Before she joined Sykdomspulsen in the middle of the pandemic (2020), she was a PhD student at the Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo (OCBE), working on hospital EHR data."

    "text": "Since the first time I tried the “academic” template in the popular blogdown package in 2019, three years have passed. Back then, it was THE way to build a personal website using R. The “academic” template was notoriously rich in content, and my solution was to delete components, compile, if it works - great; if not, I put the deleted content back. It worked for a while.\nWhen the distill package came out (probably in 2020?), I rebooted my website since I preferred its clean, minimalistic style. The look was possibly more appropriate for websites for an organisation or tutorials rather than personal blog, yet I appreciated the simplicity.\nThen I stopped updating my website. Between mid 2020 and early 2022, I was too stressed about completing my PhD, and balancing my other two jobs wasn’t the easiest thing. During this period, my mind had been going back to the old site from time to time, but it was hard to find enough time or energy to write about stuff."

    "section": "Time to try Quarto",
    "text": "Time to try Quarto\nNow that I’ve finally completed the more pressing tasks in October 2022, I can catch up to the cool kids on twitter: create a website with Quarto!\nThere were quite a lot of discussions about Quarto in the summer 2022. I wasn’t following the discussions closely, but I remember there were quite a few talks in the Rstudio conference this year. Then more and more people switched to Quarto on Twitter. Then people I know also switched to Quarto. What’s the fuzz about?\nMy experience with Quarto is focused on websites. I have not tried other forms of publishing. So far I have created:\n\na workshop website for my colleagues\na personal website (the one you are reading right now)\nan R package (qtwAcademic)that wraps three Quarto website templates for beginners\n\nHere are a few things I like about Quarto. Given that I’m not very experienced in front-end development, these comments are going to be about ease-of-use and design, rather than the technicalities.\n\nClean look for both personal and workshop/courses\nWhen I was using “academic” template in blogdown, I liked the structure of the site: projects, talks, blog, softwares and publications sections are clearly displayed at the top. What I didn’t like is that the default homepage was a very long single page; yet its customisation wasn’t the easist. Other templates were either too simple (for blog only), or more suitable for image display (photography projects). I wanted a website that keep the good structure of “academic”, which is quite suitable for academics (hence the name); while keeping each section independent.\nWith distill I could achieve the structure I wanted; but I didn’t enjoy it too much as a personal website (at least it wasn’t as flexible as Quarto). distill is still pretty decent for organisations or documentation site.\nWith Quarto, I can achieve the desired looks for not only a personal website (with or without blogs), but also a workshop, event or even course website. This is fantastic! The top, sidebar or hybrid navigation makes the site structure very clear, especially when there are lots of content. As an aspiring lecturer at university, this is really One Quarto Rules Them All.\n\n\nFlexible yet not overwhelming\nAs I mentioned above, hacking “academic” in blogdown was not that easy - simply because there were too many folders that you are not actually supposed to modify. It was confusing to know what to change in order to achieve the desired output, and multiple folders were having the same names, making it very challenging for beginners. Ironically, this is usually the first template beginners start with!\nThat’s why I immediately fell for Quarto: you only need 4 components to make a decent minimalistic website work:\n\n_quarto.yml to control the overall layout\nindex.qmd at the root folder to control the homepage\nabout.qmd for some basic information about the creator or the website\nproject.qmd for projects or any other content that the creator wants to display\n\nThe way that _quarto.yml clearly specifies the .qmd files really helps beginners to understand where things are. This has been extremely useful for me when I wanted to learn how people made their website by reading the source code - I could understand exactly where to find the information I needed. The clear structure greatly helps the creators themselves, and also those who want to learn.\n\n\nGreat community\nRstats people have a great community. I wouldn’t be able to make my site the way I wanted if people haven’t been sharing their works. I have learned a lot by reading the source code by Dr Emi Tanaka, Dr David Schoch, Bea Milz, Prof Mine Cetinnkaya-Rundel’s STA 210 - Regression Analysis course.\nI also made my own R package that wraps three templates to create Quarto websites that are frequently used by academics, qtwAcademic. In the following days I plan to write up more detailed explanations on how to use the package, along with some new features."

However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.\nEvery day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!"

    "text": "Two days ago (Jan 11 2023) I watched a presentation by data scientists at Roche about why they are making their clinical trials in 2023 open source with R. As someone who uses R for most of the time and has done similar works (not in pharma, but in public health surveillance and reporting: watch my talk, slides to find out what we do), I watched the presentation with great interest. Here are my notes, combined with some thoughts on open-source in the industry, public sector and academia.\n\nThree reasons for why I am writing this blog\n\nNote down some of the technology which points towards the future of the field\nRelate to my experience of open-source applied in public health, specifically public health reporting\nShare some thoughts in statistical education of applied students/researchers (e.g. medicine), and training Research Software Engineers\n\n\n\nMy experience with statistical software\nTo put my opinions in perspective,\n\nI do not have experience with SAS or pharma, so I do not have first-hand knowledge on the functionality, ease-of-use or the popularity of commercial softwares in the industry.\nI did my MSc and PhD in statistics/biostatistics/medical informatics and R had always been a default choice.\nI worked in public health for a few years, where Excel is possibly the most common tool, and STATA and R are scarcely used (statisticians, epidemiologists, bioinformaticians).\nIn the past few years, my university has made the switch from SPSS to STATA for intro statistics for medical students (while students at higher level, or doing advanced analyses might use R/python), and a test-run with R might be in motion.\n\n\n\n\nClinical Reporting\nIn drug development at pharmaceutical companies (and/or research institutes and hospitals), these data related tasks are very common:\n\nsummarise safety and efficacy data\nprovide accurate picture of trial outcomes\nmanage data collection across different sites\n\nCompleting these tasks in a correct, efficient and reproducible manner is crucial for patient safety. However, these tasks are also highly resource intensive: highly trained scientist, statisticians and technincians must be involved in the process. Historically, pharma use commercial software such as SAS.\n\nRegulation and exploration needs\nThere are requirements for clinical reporting: both regulartory and exploratory. From the regulatory side, there exist industry standards (CDISC) in the clinical research process, such as SDTM (Model for Tabulation of Study Data) and ADaM (Analysis Data Model). Statistical analyses, tables, listings and graphs (TLGs) also fall into this cateogory.\nFrom the exploratory side, clinical data are highly context dependent, and new formats of data such as imaging are more and more used in prediction modeling and drug development.\nIn addition, it is not hard to imagine that the technical competency of employees differ, especially in large organizations. Enabling people with less experience to analyse trial data in a reproducible manner is helpful for not only the learning and growth of employees, but also the productivity of organizations.\nThe existing commercial tools are not able to adapt to the rapid changes in the field.\n\n\nTransition into Open-Source\nIn this talk, Dr Kieran Martin at Roche introduced that they started using R as their core data science tool, aiming to move their codebase to having a core R. In the future, they plan to have something that is lanugage agnostic: meaning that python, Stan, C++, Julia and beyond can be used for different tasks.\nI only noted down a few of the things they mentioned on the infrastructure side:\n\nOCEAN - a lanugage agnostic computing platform on AWS (docker)\nGit, Gitlab for version control and collaboration\nRstudio connect server\nSnakemake for orchestrate production\n\n\n\nR and Shiny\nThere are obvious benefits of using R. It is convenient to install and use (if you used python and R, you’d probably agree), and the latest development in Shiny made it very easy to develop interactive visualizations, suitable for exploration. Package development is critical for reproducibility and distributing works - which R does it very well. A few packages developed by pharma are Teal and admiral: the ADaM in R, which I intend to check out at one point.\nR has deep roots in academia which means the newest statistical methods are well covered; which also affects the skill sets that talents own - fresh graduates probably already learned it at university. R being open source means that collaboration with external partners is much more efficient, and transparent. Strong community support is another positive thing that encourages beginners to enter the field and learn.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Sourcing Public Health\n\nSurveillance and reporting\nOne key functionality of public health (PH) authorities is stay informed and inform. They collect data from labs, hospitals and clinics across the country, summarize into useful statistics in tables and graphs, make reports, then inform the policy makers to make decisions (such as vaccination campaigns).\nCompared to clinical reporting (in my understanding), there are many similarities - we make TLG (tables, listings and graphs). There are also features that make reporting in public health unique:\n\nPH surveillance and reporting are dynamic and real-time, which can change in a matter of days. That is because the situation of different infectious diseases can evolve rapidly, so PH authorities need to make appropriate adjustments.\nTime and location (spatial-temporal) are important. Different time granularity (daily, weekly) and geographical units (nation, county, municipality, city districts) are typically required for reporting.\n\n\n\nScale up and automate with open source tools\nTraditionally, these reports are made manually - one location, one graph per time on a certain disease. When a global pandemic hits, this is definitely not fast enough. At my team (Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health), we tried a different approach. Details of what we did can be found in this talk(slides), but to make it brief:\n\nWe developed a fully automated pipeline that connects 15 registries (vaccination, lab, hospital and intensive care and many more). The data is gathered, censored, cleaned and pre-processed for down-stream analysis\nStatistical analysis, tables, graphs and maps are made for all locations in Norway for various outcomes of interest, such as Covid, influenza, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections\nOver 1000 customized reports with over 30 graphs and tables are produced daily and sent to local PH officials, where we also had a shiny website (Kommunehelsetjenester for Kommunelege) for over 300 PH officials to get most up-to-date information about their own municipality\n\nBy automation, every year Sykdomspulsen can save 700 000 NOK (roughly 70k USD) while making 400 times more real-time reports for public health. Even better, with reproducibility and quality control.\n\n\nToolbox\nSykdomspulsen is a small team (8 people, 3 are statisticians and 1 engineer), and our infrastructure was built upon R packages, which we call splverse. Our infrastructure is not fundamentally different from the one Roche introduced, basically:\n\nR does the task planning and project organization. On top of this, the data cleaning, statistical analysis are implemented. Graphs, tables and maps are made with appropriate R packages\nRmarkdown does automated reporting into .docx and .xlsx. Some reports are also in .html tables to be embedded into customized emails\nRstudio Workbench and GitHub help with teamwork\n\nDocker, GoCD and Airflow do the CI/CD and orchestration\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace the transition\n\nCulture change needed\nUnfortunately, not all organizations are eager to abandon the old way. Even at our own institute where researchers are the majority, open source and modern day programming is hardly practiced (by my observation). Even worse, under the budget cuts in 2023-24, a large number of younger employees who have the technical skills have left - which left the public health surveillance even more vulnerable now that Covid is far from over.\nIn my opinion, public health needs open-source and good programming even more than pharmaceutical companies. Both save lifes - and PH has less money to invest in softwares, infrastructures and talents. In this situation, resources should be spent in fields that are critical and most cost-effective; yet in reality this is often not the case.\nThe slow culture change at big organizations can happen, but only if there is a sufficient amount of employees who are willing to embrace the new technology. In the talk by Roche they about about their training strategy. It is not possible to train all users, and not everyone has the same needs at the same time. Therefore, self study with certain study paths is encouraged and supported.\n\n\nTeach programming to students in various fields\nBased on my experience in the UK and Norway, students (myself included) learn R programming in one of the two ways\n\nLearning by Googling (self-taught): a university degree needs to use it: provides a short introduction, then students learn by using. This is how I learned R at my MSc Statistics degree, and this is probably the most common way\nWorkshops at university: organizations such as the Carpentries provide course material and teaching a few times per year, where interested students (usually from subjects such as biology) come and learn. These classes are quite popular, and usually have a long waiting list.\n\nFrom learning by googling to some organized teaching - that is already some good progress. However, if not, can we improve?\nIn my experience with statistical advising with the university hospital, clinical researchers and medical students are enthusastic to get their statistics done, some are also eager to do some analysis themselves. That is good. Yet, there is generally lack of capacity - either knowledge or software skills. Once the statistician who helps with the project stops, the project ends. There is the need to have in-house statistical capacity. To this end, open-source softwares such as R, and good programming practice (reproducibility for example) can help a lot: the license doesn’t end, and everything is documented so that the next person can continue the work.\nI’m glad that my university has made some transitional efforts in this regard: STATA instead of SPSS is being taught to medical students as part of their statistics course. There might be a test-run in R soon, which is very exciting (since I’ll be involved in the teaching)!\n\n\nStatistical engineering and RSEs\nThat was the capacity building to get beginners more independent. On the other side, there is also the need for better programming practice for researchers at more advanced level. Research Software Engineering (RSE) is starting to get more and more attention, because it is not only relevant for research (i.e. getting papers published), but in broader applications.\nFor example, in the talk by Roche, they mentioned that “RSE teams need to accelerate adoption of new statistical methods and biomarker data analysis”, and the implementation with R packages and templates is at its core. In the future more languages would be included such as Python, Stan, C++ and Julia.\nHowever, RSE as a job title or career path is still a new thing. I know two RSEs at my university, and RSE is definitely not your typical academic faculty position: only departments that think it’s important makes positions, often not permanent. To get any new methods actually used in either industry or the public sector outside research, translating methods into tools is must-do. In the future I hope RSE becomes a stable and common career path, and more exciting things can happen."
