## Data science in Public Health

I joined the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in 2020, as a member of the Sykdomspulsen team. We are a core part of the COVID-19 pandemic response task force in Norway. I help build the real-time public health surveillance platform using R and other open source data science tools. You can find our R packages [here](https://github.com/sykdomspulsen-org).

In 2021-2022, I am the responsible statistician for NorMOMO, the Norwegian Mortality Monitoring project, which is part of the European network EuroMOMO. I work on R packages [nowcast](https://docs.sykdomspulsen.no/nowcast/) and [splalert](https://docs.sykdomspulsen.no/splalert/).
