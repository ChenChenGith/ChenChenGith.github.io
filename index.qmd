::: {#hero-heading}

Hello! I am a statistical programmer at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo. I develop open source tools (**R packages, quarto websites**) in my daily work.

As a part-time lecturer, I teach **statistics** courses at Oslo Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology ([OCBE](https://www.med.uio.no/imb/english/research/centres/ocbe/)) and **R programming** at the [Carpentries workshops](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/carpentry-uio/) at University of Oslo.

In 2020-2022, I worked as R developer and statistician for the open source real-time analysis and public health surveillance system, Sykdomspulsen (now [CSIDS](https://www.csids.no)) at the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/en/). Prior to that, I did my PhD at University of Oslo which was on RWD/EHR data.

I enjoy cooking and spending time in the mountains.
